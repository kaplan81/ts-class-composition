# TypeScript Class Composition

This project has been created from scratch without any frameworks or bundlers.

It aims to demonstrate TypeScript and TypeScript compiler capabilities to compose classes.

## Development server

If you have never build the project, do a first build for the first version of the composed app:

```bash
npm run build --verflag=1
```

Then serve the project:

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically open your browser in `http://localhost:8080/`.

The app will not automatically reload for any changes you make. You will need to do a hard reload.

If you want to build a different version just runt the sama build command but changing the value of the `--verflag`.
